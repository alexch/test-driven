# Summary

A talk about Test-Driven Development, based on my own experience, with much inspiration from Kent Beck, Gerard Meszaros, Rob Mee, and many other Agile greats.

I've been delivering this talk in one form or another since the early 2000s. In this repo is a `.ppt` file from the last time I gave it to a client back in 2007. In May 2012 I unearthed it and converted it to [deck.rb](http://github.com/alexch/deck.rb) format, which is basically Markdown, and updated it a bit to have more examples in Ruby.

It's also on SlideShare at <http://www.slideshare.net/alexchaffee/test-driven> but again, that's an older version (at least for now).

# Usage

First, install Ruby. Next...

    gem install deckrb
    deck test-driven.deck.md

Mac:

    open http://localhost:4333

Windows:

    start http://localhost:4333
